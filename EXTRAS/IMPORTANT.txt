Hello teacher everything is suppose to work but just in case here you have some annotations

1.
In database file in server/config the connection is made via (127.0.0.1) instead of (locahost)
for some reasons my computer only accept this direction so, if mongo doesn't not works for you
you can change it to localhost as normal


2.
The database name is ("usersypolls") only creating it, it should work
but you coul see the collections in the other file of this folder

3.
I didn't change the date format because of time, but it works perfectly

4.
 If you need any othe information or something is not working just let me know
 From my side everything is working perfectly i hope that from yours too
